## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

For the first time I have a sense of a real-life project haven viewed the project structure, and comprehending the fundamentals of a project style guide.

I learnt the use of HTML 5 for the frame of the a project and the CSS for it's aesthetics. Knowing how to implement @media Queries, Fluid Grids, Flexible images and modern CSS layouts (Flexbox and Grid) for responsiveness.

See code examples below:

```html
<div class="container">
    <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code">
    <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
  </div>
```
```css
.container img { max-width: 100%; border-radius: 10px; 
      box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.065); }

```
```media query
@media (min-width: 320px) {
      .container { flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;
      } 
    }
```


### Continued development

Going forward, learning React, working with github copilot, ChatGPT, the MERN Stack will be what i look forward to achieving.
